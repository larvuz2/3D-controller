Deployment Steps:

1. Push your code to GitHub

   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Select GitHub and authorize
   - Select your repository (3D-controller)
   - Configure build settings:
     - Build command: npm run build
     - Publish directory: dist
   - Click "Deploy site"

3. Netlify will automatically build and deploy your site
   - The site will be available at a Netlify subdomain (e.g., https://your-site-name.netlify.app)
   - You can configure a custom domain in the Netlify settings

4. For subsequent deployments, just push to GitHub
